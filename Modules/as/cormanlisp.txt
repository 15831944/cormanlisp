This distribution of AllegroServe was based on AllegroServe 1.1.25 and
modified by Chris Double to work with Corman Lisp 1.42. It is not
supported by Franz, authors of AllegroServe, and is not fully working
- more work still needs to be done on the port. In particular
keep-alive and chunking support does not work. That said, much of the
web server functionality works fine, and it can serve pages without
too much problem.

Note that I made some modifications to the client support to allow
using SSL sockets to retrieve web pages.

I've distributed it now to allow others to use it in case I don't get
a chance to work on it in the near future. Comments, bugs and
suggestions can be sent to chris@double.nz.
