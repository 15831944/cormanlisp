Corman Lisp 1.21 Release Notes
March 28, 1999

Corman Lisp Kernel

This release fixes several bugs in the kernel, and several new
functions have been added. CLOS implementation is now
faster, and will work better when combined with foreign function
callbacks.

CLOS instances are now native types, and are no longer implemented
as structures.

Corman Lisp IDE

A preferences dialog has been added, which allows you to turn
off various features of the editor. These will be saved automatically
each time you exit the IDE.

Automatic prototyping of Common Lisp functions occurs when you
are working in the editor. This may be turned off in the 
Preferences dialog.
