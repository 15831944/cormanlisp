Corman Lisp 2.01 Updates
February 22, 2003

Corman Lisp 2.01 includes improved ANSI Common Lisp 
compatibility, defect fixes, and feature enhancements. 
Some of these have previously been available as patches 
from the Corman Lisp web site. These changes represent the 
difference from the released version of 2.0 without patches. 

This is a free update to all licensed users of Corman Lisp 2.0,
and is intended to replace version 2.0. Compiled image files
must be re-compiled to use the new 2.01 kernel.


IDE:

-Fixed a problem with storing/loading the preferred font name.

-Fixed a problem where file mappings were occurring each time 
 you run the IDE.

-Increased the version for CormanLisp.exe to 2.01.

-Modified the installer to not map .cl files.

-Removed dependency on oleacc.dll (accessibility layer).

-Fixed incompatibilities with Windows 95/98.

-Fixed a problem with the direct call lambda list lookup. Errors are 
 now ignored.

-Added option to edit file and line number from context menu.

-Added column position indicator to edit window status bar.

-Added ability to escape the splash screen at startup (escape key).


Compiler:

-Fixed a problem with compiler warnings. When a function was not 
 defined, the name of the function was not included in the warning 
 message.

-Speedup of STRING= function (this improves performance in a 
 variety of functions).

-Kernel and CLOS changes to support capturing the lexical environments 
 in method definitions (methods can be closures).

-Improvements to array performance.

-Updated boot apps to no longer use the command line for .img file.

-Fixed some definitions in win32.lisp and winbase.lisp.

-Fixed LOAD when using *LOAD-VERBOSE* and *LOAD-WITHOUT-EVAL* switches.

-Fixed a problem in symbol-macro expansion.

-Optimization declarations in LET and LET* forms are now available 
 in compiler macros.

-Reimplemented kernel function %OUTPUT-CHARS, which 
 fixes a problem where stream-position was not being updated with 
 WRITE-LINE and WRITE-STRING.

-Added CHAR= optimization in characters.lisp.

-Added package "SYS".

-Added DEFUN-POINTER for invoking foreign functions using foreign 
 function pointers.

-Added some compiler macros to speed up character processing.


Common Lisp:

-SETF of generic functions works correctly.

-Modified expand.lisp to handle some cases with symbol-macros.

-Modified pretty-printer to handle dotted lists.

-Modified reader character macro reader to handle *READ-SUPPRESS*.

-Modified WRITE to work with Environment structures.

-FBOUNDP will now return NIL for functions which have been bound 
 to stubs by the compiler (to generate undefined function errors).

-Literal dot symbols are now distinguished from list markers.

-Added support for top-level symbol macros.

-Added DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO implementation.

-Modified TRACE to not add a trace function if it is already being traced.

-Fixed a problem with INTERN and strings with fill pointers.

-Fixed a problem with MACROLET and duplicate names.

-Doc strings in DEFMETHOD forms can now precede the declarations.

-Fixed SETF to allow THE forms as places.


Enhancements and fixes from JP Massar:

-Added ARRAY-IN-BOUNDS-P function.

-Added implementation of CHARACTER function.

-Added implementation of DIGIT-CHAR function.

-Added implementation of BOTH-CASE-P function.

-Incorporated fixes to LOAD.

-Added (partial) implementation of WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.

-Incorporated fix for COMPILE-FILE and PROGN top-level forms.

-Defect fix for DEFPACKAGE.

-In DEFPACKAGE macro, :IMPORT-FROM and :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM now handle 
 package designators and symbol designators.

-Modifications to DESCRIBE.

-Incorporated fix to avoid warning in DESTRUCTURING-BIND.

-Added MASK-FIELD and DEPOSIT-FIELD.

-Incorporated fix to %chars-to-float (internal function).

-New definition of MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND.

-Removed warning from IMPORT.

-Fixed a problem with :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST in OPEN.
 Improvements to DEFTYPE.


Enhancements and fixes from Karsten Poeck:

-Added WITH-PACKAGE-ITERATOR macro implementation.

-Added WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.

-Fixes for APROPOS-LIST, DO-SYMBOLS.

-Modification to (internal) PACKAGE-FIND-SYMBOL


Modules/Libraries:

-Mods to odbc package to work with Corman Lisp 2.0.

-Added mp-locks.lisp to Modules. (This was accidentally left out of 2.0.)

-Added console.lisp module.
