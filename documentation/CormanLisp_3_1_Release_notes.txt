Corman Lisp 3.1 Release Notes
December. 30, 2018

It is the first community release intended for real use.

The main objectives of this release are:
* to make the system usable on the modern versions of the Windows operating system, especially the 64-bit ones;
* to improve the stability of the runtime and kernel code;
* to improve basic functionality of the IDE;
* to fix long-standing bugs;
* to prepare the ground for the future development.

Nevertheless, it contains a lot of new features.

New in this release:

- Support for modern, x64 editions of Windows - it does not crash when intensively using FFI.
 The application itself is still a 32-bit one.

- New customisable high-quality Lisp code indenting engine in the IDE (Dorai Sitaram's 'scmindent').
 The functionality is used during source-code editing and is also available via the context menu for reindenting the selected code.

- Hardware-assisted garbage collector mode (experimental, disabled by default).
 See the new functions ENABLE-HARDWARE-GC and HARDWARE-GC-ENABLED-P (Chapter 12 of the Corman Lisp manual). One can find :HARDWARE-GC keyword in *FEATURES* when this functionality is available (it is always available starting from Corman Lisp 3.1 and onwards).

- Support for multi-user environments.
 The Corman Lisp does not assume that it has write permissions to the installation directory.
 See Chapter 6 of the Corman Lisp manual for the additional details.

- User specific initialisation file (%USERPROFILE%\corman-init.lisp).

- Support for high-DPI screens in the IDE.

- Support for IPv6 (when available on the platform).
One can find :IPV6 keyword in *FEATURES* when this functionality is available.

- Support for datagram sockets.
One can find :DATAGRAM-SOCKETS keyword in *FEATURES* when this functionality is available.

- Networking sockets library does not need specific initialisation any more.
 The START-SOCKETS and STOP-SOCKETS are dummy functions which are available for compatibility reasons.

- SSL sockets module does not need any specific initialisation.
 The START-SSL-SOCKETS is a dummy function which is available only for compatibility reasons.

- SSL sockets module now uses TLS by default.

- New MSI-based installer authored with WiX 3.x.

- Installer creates %CORMANLISP_HOME% environmental variable which contains Corman Lisp installation directory (to make it easier to integrate it into the other projects).

- Visual Studio 2015 is used to build the project.

- The Visual Studio solution was reorganised to make it easier to build the project and contribute.
 The only optional dependency is WiX 3.x which is used to build the installer.

- The third party libraries were updated to the latest versions when possible.

- All old Corman Lisp licensing code is properly removed.

- Support for Windows operating system versions older than Windows XP SP3 is dropped.

- It is possible to load a Lisp image without crashing the IDE (all the time ;).
 Corman Lisp is one of the few modern implementations which provide image loading functionality without restarting the process.

- New LOAD-DEFAULT-IMAGE function.
 See Chapter 22 of the Corman Lisp manual.

- Numerous improvements to the CLOS implementation.

- Numerous improvements to the kernel and runtime code.

- Numerous bug fixes.

- Numerous stability improvements.

What is missing (planned for the next releases):
 - Support for the recent version of ASDF.
 - Support for the new efficient thread synchronisation primitives available starting from Windows Vista and newer.

New examples:
- Minesweepers AI and GUI demo (examples/minesweepers.lisp).
