The Corman Lisp compiler, run-time system,
IDE and most associated components and have been developed 
by Roger Corman. Several of the included components had
other authors, however.

Frances Corman is now a part of the Corman Lisp team, and
has revised the manual for this release. Ethan Stone is a 
senior software engineer for Corman Technologies, and has
made contributions to the 3.0 release, including many of the
new GUI features and the Othello sample program.

Chris Double has a great web site at:
http://double.nz/cl/index.htm 

which contains all kinds of Corman Lisp add-on features and 
programs (which he has personally developed). He continues 
to provide excellent support to others, and moderates the 
Corman Lisp message board. Many of Chris's works are included,
with his permission, with the Corman Lisp product.
 
Vassili Bykov has provided the sophisticated C-header
parser for loading foreign interface definitions. This is
extremely nice and useful, and is included in full with the
Corman Lisp package. He has also contributed translations of
several Windows header files, as well as some Common Lisp 
library functions.

Reini Urban has done a lot of work to help make Corman Lisp
function as an extension under Autocad. His modifications are
included in this release.

Chris Double has contributed many bug fixes and enhancements 
for Corman Lisp, and has a nice Corman Lisp site at 
http://double.nz/cl/.

Erann Gat has assisted us with obtaining the cormanlisp.com
domain registration.

The CLOS implementation is derived from the work of 
Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivières, and Daniel G. Bobrow
and is very well documented in their book "Art of the 
Metaobject Protocol". The code is Copyright (c) 1990, 1991 
Xerox Corporation.

The random number facility is from the CMU Common Lisp 
project (CMU Lisp) and was riginally written by David Adam.  
Rob MacLachlan also contributed.

The LOOP facility is from MIT, and lists Glenn Burke as one
of the authors. See the file LOOP.LISP for more details.

Kent Pitman has developed the wonderful HyperSpec, which can
be browsed from within Corman Lisp. This is an incredible 
document which covers not only ANSI Common Lisp, but much 
of the language design process as well. Thanks for your 
efforts, Kent. In general, thanks to all the members of the 
ANSI Common Lisp standard committee X3J13 for standardizing
such a powerful language.

Thanks to Guy Steele Jr., whose books Common Lisp: The 
Language, both editions, are a constant source of assistance 
and amusement (in the most positive sense). Corman Lisp also 
includes the optimized backquote facility from the second 
edition, as well as some other functions from the book.

Rainer Joswig's e-mail discussions with me early in the
Corman Lisp development inspired several of the features of
Corman Lisp, including the support for OS native threads.

Peter Norvig's book Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence 
Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp taught me a lot 
about the language and his many sample programs were useful
in debugging the Corman Lisp compiler.The source to his 
Eliza program is included as an example with this release.

Paul Graham has been an inspiration as well, through his
excellent books "ANSI Common Lisp" and "On Lisp".

Source examples are included from numerous people, including
Larry Hunter and Vassili Bykov.

People who have been influential in my Lisp understanding 
over the years include:

Arthur Hills
Jim Bisso
David Betz
Henry Baker
... and many others.

My parrot contributed the feather in the Corman Lisp 
3.0 graphic.

Thanks also to all the licensed users of Corman Lisp and 
PowerLisp, who helped to support me over the years with 
advice as well as financial support.

Thanks to my wife Frances, children Amy and Emmett, and
grandson Cyrus, for helping me and putting up with me 
when I have been unavailable or in need of sleep.
