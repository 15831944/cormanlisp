purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media 
on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of 
defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  
Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".

BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CORMAN TECHNOLOGIES OR ITS LICENSORS 
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE 
DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE 
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF CORMAN TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Corman 
Technolgies' liability to you, whether in contract, tort 
(including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by 
you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations

essential purpose.

6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective until
terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
destroying all copies of Software.  This Agreement will
terminate immediately without notice from Corman Technologies if 
you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.  Upon

that you have the responsibility to obtain such licenses to
export, re-export, or import as may be required after
delivery to you.

8.  U.S.  Government Restricted Rights.  If Software is
being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.  Government or by
a U.S.  Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any
tier), then the Government's rights in Software and
accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this
Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201

will be governed by California law and controlling U.S.
federal law.  No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction
will apply.

10.  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in
effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would
frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement
between you and Corman Technologies relating to its 
subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
oral or written communications, proposals, representations
