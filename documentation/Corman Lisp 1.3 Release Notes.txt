Corman Lisp 1.3 Release Notes
May 25, 1999

Corman Lisp Kernel:

Memory allocation is much more flexible, and should allow Corman
Lisp to function properly as an embedded compiler/evaluator in
most applications.

SETF has been modified to allow a macro to be used as the place
argument (as per the ANSI specification).

DEFSETF "short form" has been modified to require that the passed
function take its value as the last argument, rather than the first,
as per the ANSI specification. This may affect your source code,
so be aware of this.

The SOME function has been fixed.


Other Modifications:

Some documentation errors were corrected.

Reini Urban's Autocad support (thanks, Reini!)

The console application has been rewritten as a normal console
app, supporting i/o redirection and any other native console 
app features. The source code is much smaller and simpler.

Both the clboot application and the clconsole application are
modified to reflect that virtual memory is allocated more
dynamically than before.

The Corman Lisp IDE, console and boot apps are now linked to run
with release DLLs as opposed to debug DLLs.

The code for each of these apps has been modified to always
look for a copy of CormanLispServer.dll in the same directory
as the running .exe file. Only if not found there will it use
the registered COM server version. This should make it 
easier to support having more than one version of Corman Lisp
apps running on a system.
